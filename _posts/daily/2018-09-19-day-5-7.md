## Todays Goals

### Come up with workable abstraction for Vulkan pipeline creation

This didn't happen. At this point there's will too many unknowns on how best to abstract the pipeline creation. This will be deferred for the next days goals.

### Finish refactoring down 'triangle' program

The 'triangle' program's worst boilerplate code has been refactored down, and the last remaining section was the pipeline creation code, that, as above, I did not have enough information or knowledge on how to abstract it yet.

### Fix issues with updated vksbc

The issues with vksbc was quite simply that the whole string up to the extension was being used for the variable names in the created headers. The simple fix here was to jsut chop off the whole path being left with just the actual file name.

## Extra Goals Accomplished

### Texture cube

<span class="image fit">
    <img src="/assets/posts/daily/7-textured_cube.jpeg" />
</span>

In addition to the original red triangle program, another was also created during the past few days, and that was to build up an example program that displays a textured cube. This went without much issue, with the code to upload an image being fairly close to that of uploading a Vulkan buffer.

## Tomorrow's Goals
- Create an example of Vulkan 'instancing'
- Vulkan pipeline abstraction
