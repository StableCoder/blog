This is the first post of what will become a (near) daily series describing my journey towards becoming, and doing better.

Specifically, I've set out to build a new project, that, through the use of this blog daily streams, summary videos, and posts, will keep myself motiviated to actually accomplish something of true value. I have done a whole bunch of smallish items, fits and spurts of productivity, but when it comes to a larger project, have always run out of steam before accomplishing too much. This hopefully changes that.

That said, *I have NO idea what I'm going to be doing yet*.

## Todays Goals

The first day's goals were simple enough:
- Setup git repository on Gitlab: This was easy enough, and is located [here](https://git.stabletec.com/foe-engine/main/)
- Setup code coverage: Again easy enough, using refined code from this [original post]({% post_url 2018-01-15-code-coverage %})
- Setup setup sanitizers: Check out the [original post]({% post_url 2018-02-01-analyzer-build-types %})
- Doxygen documentation generation
- Automated tests
- Automated builds

### CMake Scripts

For the most part, the items were quickly built up using the previously created [CMake scripts](https://git.stabletec.com/other/cmake-scripts) set, outlined in several previous posts, albeit refined, and otherwise taken from other piecemeal works.

### Issues

For the most part these were achieved, however issues were encountered in the Windows docker builds for the automated pipeline where windows containers, at least when running using Hyper-V isolation always silently fail when an application attempts to use a non-powershell or non-cmd shell. So, to deal with that will be the requirement of creating windows docker images that instead have the Catch2 header included so that it doesn't have to be cloned via git.

## Tomorrow's Goals
- Build FoE-specific docker images. These will include at least the catch header, and probably other libraries of future expansion.
- Get Windows docker builds working. Basically by creating images specifically for building this repository.
- Add doxygen documentation job to CI pipeline.
- Add doxygen documentation and code coverage imaging to CI . This will mean being capable of auto-deploying such images to be veiwable on the web.
- Figure out initial code to implement, and a starting direction for the project.
